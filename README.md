# feature-flag-relay-proxy

resources for deploying the relay proxy for harness feature flags

# what is included

`docker` resources for deploying the proxy with docker

`kubernetes` resources for deploying the proxy with kubernetes

`test` helpful scripts for testing the proxy

`.harness` a harness pipeline that tests all these configurations

# general guidance

the three things you will need to deploy the relay proxy:

- ADMIN_SERVICE_TOKEN: a harness api key with project viewer for the projects in which the proxy will cover
  - a single relay proxy instance can cover any combination of projects under a single organization, so an org view key is reccomended
- API_KEYS: server sdk keys for each environment you want the proxy to allow connections for
  - when using multiple sdk keys, seperate them with a comma
